Mint theme fork, fully black
=====================

1. Add new colors to `constants.py`
2. Add new hue to `colorize.py`
3. Add the new color name to the lists in `update-variations.py`
4. Run the Python script `update-variations.py` for the new color (e.g. `./update-variations.py Red`). 
This will generate new assets in `src/Mint-Y/variations/`.
5. Manually create a new directory for the new theme in `files/usr/share/themes`. It's best to copy an existing one as a template.
    
    In there:
    - Adapt the theme name in `index.theme`.
    - Create new `thumbnail.png` images.
6. Run the Python script `generate-themes.py`. This will create the themes in the local directory `usr/share/themes`.
7. Test the themes by copying them to `~/.themes` and applying them.
8. In Git commit and push all newly created files to a new branch.
